On A Cloud - Demo App
=======

This application uses the Soundcloud API to stream and play tracks by genre. Once a search is performed, the
Soundcloud API is queried for a list of related songs, ranked in order of 'hotness' - a metric calculated by Soundcloud.
On the results page, a custom front-end displays album art and song information, with playback enabled through the use
of the Audio.js Javascript library. 

A live version of the application can be found at http://onacloud.herokuapp.com.
